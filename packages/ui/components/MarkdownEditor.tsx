   * Extra CodeMirror 6 extensions, forwarded verbatim to the underlying editor
   * (e.g. `wikiLinks(config)`, collaboration bindings like y-codemirror.next).
   * They are appended after the editor's built-ins, so they compose on top —
   * use `Prec.high` from `@codemirror/state` when an extension must beat a
   * built-in keymap. Build them against YOUR copy of the `@codemirror/*`
   * packages; two live copies of `@codemirror/state` break the editor.
   *
   * ⚠️ CAPTURED ONCE PER `documentId` — NOT reactive. The engine reads this
   * array a single time, when it mounts the document (keyed on `documentId`).
   * Swapping in a different array afterwards does NOT re-apply it: the change
   * is silently ignored until the next remount (i.e. a `documentId` change).
   * Therefore:
   *   - pass a stable reference (module constant, or `useMemo` keyed on
   *     `documentId`), and
   *   - never encode changing data in the array itself. Extension config
   *     callbacks MAY close over live state (refs/getters) — that is the
   *     supported way to feed dynamic data into a mounted editor.
