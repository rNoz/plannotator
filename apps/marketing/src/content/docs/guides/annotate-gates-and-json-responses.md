`plannotator annotate` and `plannotator annotate-last` accept three flags that turn markdown annotation into a full review gate with structured output. Direct `plannotator annotate` invocations also support strict automation with `--require-approval` and `--result-file`.

## Capabilities

- **`--gate`** adds an Approve button to the annotation UI. The reviewer picks one of three decisions: approve, send annotations, or close.
- **`--json`** emits every decision as a structured JSON object on stdout so hooks and plugins can route on the outcome without parsing free text.
- **`--hook`** emits hook-native JSON that works directly with Claude Code and Codex PostToolUse/Stop hook protocols. Implies `--gate`. Recommended for hook integrations.
- The flags compose. Use any alone or together.
- Identical semantics across every supported harness: Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Pi, and Codex.

### JSON schema

```json
{
  "decision": "approved" | "annotated" | "dismissed",
  "feedback": "string (present for annotated decisions and approvals with notes)"
}
```

### Example outputs

**Approved** (reviewer clicked Approve, `--gate --json`):

```json
{"decision":"approved"}
```

If the reviewer approves while leaving notes, direct structured transport preserves both:

```json
{"decision":"approved","feedback":"Keep the retry bounded."}
```

**Dismissed** (reviewer clicked Close, `--json` or `--gate --json`):

```json
{"decision":"dismissed"}
```

**Annotated** (reviewer sent annotations, `--json` or `--gate --json`). The `feedback` field is the same markdown Plannotator emits in plaintext mode:

```json
{
  "decision": "annotated",
  "feedback": "# File Feedback\n\nI've reviewed this file and have 2 pieces of feedback:\n\n## 1. Remove this\n`the selected text`\n> I don't want this.\n\n## 2. Feedback on: \"some highlighted text\"\n> This needs more detail.\n\n---"
}
```

The object is emitted as a single line of JSON per invocation. One invocation, one decision, one line on stdout.

## `--gate`

A three-way review decision. The annotation UI adds an Approve button alongside Close and Send Annotations. The reviewer declares intent explicitly:

- **Approve.** The artifact is good as written. The agent should proceed.
- **Send Annotations.** The reviewer has specific changes. The feedback is returned verbatim.
- **Close.** The session ends without a decision. Neither a signal to the agent nor an instruction set.

In plaintext mode, Approve emits the single line `The user approved.` on stdout so templates and agents can distinguish approval from close without needing `--json`. Close emits nothing. Send Annotations emits the feedback markdown. For hook integrations, use `--hook` instead, which emits hook-native JSON directly.

## `--json`

Structured stdout. Every decision is emitted as a JSON object with a `decision` field and optionally a `feedback` payload. Hooks and plugins that need explicit routing (log approvals separately from dismissals, gate on decision type, accumulate telemetry) use this.

`--json` is orthogonal to `--gate`:

- `--json` alone keeps the two-button UI. Only `annotated` and `dismissed` decisions are emitted.
- `--gate --json` unlocks all three decisions in structured form.
- Direct `--gate --json` approval can include feedback. Transports that can
  deliver approval but not attached notes warn before discarding feedback and
  direct the reviewer to **Send Feedback** instead.
- On OpenCode and Pi, `--json` is accepted silently. Those harnesses write back to the session directly rather than via stdout, so the flag has no effect there. Recipes remain portable.

## `--hook`

Emits hook-native JSON that works directly with Claude Code and Codex PostToolUse/Stop hook protocols. Implies `--gate` (always three-button UX). If both `--hook` and `--json` are passed, `--hook` wins.

- Approve → empty stdout → hook passes → agent proceeds.
- Close → empty stdout → hook passes → agent proceeds.
- Send Annotations → `{"decision":"block","reason":"<feedback>"}` → hook blocks with feedback.

This is the recommended approach for hook integrations. The `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` format is the native protocol both Claude Code and Codex use for PostToolUse and Stop hooks. No wrapper script needed.

`--hook` remains intentionally unchanged: approval is represented by empty
stdout in the native hook protocol, so it has no channel for approval notes.
Use **Send Feedback** to block with notes; that action still means “revise and
reopen,” not “approve and continue.”

The flag is accepted silently on OpenCode and Pi for the same reason `--json` is: those harnesses don't use stdout as the signal channel.

## Strict direct gates

For a fail-closed direct CLI gate, add either or both strict options:

```sh
plannotator annotate docs/plan.md --gate --json \
  --require-approval \
  --result-file .tmp/plan-review-result.json
```

- **`--require-approval`** exits `0` only for `approved`. `annotated` and `dismissed` still publish their valid JSON decision, then exit nonzero.
- **`--result-file <path>`** atomically publishes the same newline-terminated JSON bytes written to stdout. The path is resolved from the invocation working directory.
- Both options require `--gate --json`, are available only on direct `annotate` invocations, and cannot be combined with `--hook`. Hook output and exit behavior are unchanged.

The result-file parent directory must already exist and the destination must not. Plannotator writes a private `0600` temporary file in the same directory, flushes and closes it, then publishes it with an atomic no-clobber hard link. It never overwrites an existing destination or falls back to a non-atomic copy. Use a unique result path for every invocation.

Keep the reviewed source at a stable project path so revisions and version history continue to refer to the same artifact. Result and diagnostic log files can instead live in a narrowly scoped temporary directory.

Clicking Close publishes `{"decision":"dismissed"}`. Closing or crashing the browser outside that explicit action is not guaranteed to produce a decision; callers should treat a missing result or failed process as a recovery case, never as approval.

## Primary use cases

### Spec-driven development frameworks

Spec-driven development frameworks like spec-kit, kiro, and openspec generate multiple markdown artifacts per feature: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`. Each goes through clarify, review, and approve cycles. Plannotator's annotation UI is a first-class fit for reviewing these artifacts: inline, targeted feedback on markdown is exactly what these workflows need.

With `--gate`, a PostToolUse hook on Write triggers a full review gate every time the agent produces a spec artifact. The reviewer approves, annotates, or dismisses. The agent proceeds, revises, or skips accordingly.

### Turn-by-turn review

`plannotator annotate-last --gate` wired into a Claude Code Stop hook pauses every agent turn for human review. Approve closes the turn cleanly. Send Annotations re-prompts the agent with the reviewer's feedback. Close ends the turn without injecting anything.

### Programmatic decision routing

When a hook or plugin needs to distinguish approve from dismiss, `--json` provides a single-line, stable contract. One-shot decisions become machine-readable events. No stdout parsing, no fragility.

## Hook integration recipes

See [Hook Integration](/docs/guides/hook-integration/) for copy-paste recipes that wire these flags into PostToolUse and Stop hooks on Claude Code, plus portable variants for OpenCode and Pi.

## Exit codes

By default, every decision exits `0`; existing plaintext, JSON, and hook integrations are unchanged. With `--require-approval`, only `approved` exits `0`; `annotated` and `dismissed` publish their JSON result before exiting `1`. Strict invocations that are misconfigured or cannot start or deliver a decision — bad flag combinations, an invalid `--result-file` destination, or a failed atomic publish — exit `2` without publishing a decision, following the grep convention (`0` approved, `1` not approved, `2` the gate itself errored).
